In the game, he clearly operated in front of the defense and always remained defensively oriented during attacks.

He also had his moments in offensive set pieces and was dangerous due to his heading ability, even providing an assist with a header. However, his passing game showed too many inaccuracies, leading to turnovers. Overall, a solid performance, but at 33 years old, probably no longer of interest to us.",
